# Night Owl

## Introduction

This simple Google Chrome extension takes the RGB values of the webpage and calculates the opposite of it and outputs the value on the page. This in turn inverts the entire webpage. In addition, if the extension detects an image, it will not invert that but will invert the colors of the elements around it. Feel free to download this extension and load it into your Chrome browser.
